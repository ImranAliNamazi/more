<p class="speakable">Chief Ideator's Message - Sep 2022</p>

1. What is a word truly worth? Was it worth our time, emotion, energy?
2. Do we choose carefully our words? Are we reaffirming a positive spirit or reinforcing a negative thought or experience? Are we shy or self conscious or feel we are inarticulate?
3. It is said to be mindful of our thoughts for they become -> words -> actions -> habits -> character and finally our legacy to the rest of humanity. Is it possible to think through feelings? Convey feelings without words? Or in as few words as possible? Does the music we hear, the stories we read and the content we watch really inspire us, making us more compassionate and brimming with positivity?
4. Can we begin a new phase in our lives of mindfulness, reflection and most deliberate action? Never forgetting to smell the roses on the way, or to break out in smiles, laughter and be oft moved to tears? Can we promise ourselves to always be strong and be a salve of healing to our fellow beings? Can we let ourselves be ourselves without fear of judgement or seeming vulnerable or even downright quirky?
5. You may not believe the levels of creativity within us that we can cultivate when we listen deep to the song of life and let it burst forth in our speech.
6. We dont often pamper ourselves with the time and effort to invest in our own happiness, for most often we are either stressed due to enormous constraints and pains, or trying to catch a moment's peace, or somewhat idle / mindless.
7. Can we promise to change our habits and reach for the stars, being our own heroes?
