> They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They come through you but not from you...

> You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.

> The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.
>
> Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;
>
> For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.
