# Introduction

Inspired by the title of the [Robert Govers' book of the same name](https://www.imaginativecommunities.com/), I intend this workshop in 3 parts, each with a interlude into breakout rooms.

* Session 1: Inspiration from fiction and mythology that should fill our imagination with acts heroic.
* Session 2: Inspiration from History and People Gone that should remind us the world is a better place for their having lived.
* Session 3: Inspiration from people living an embodied divinity whom we should reach out to.

> **The EARTH IS DYING and we are running out of time in which to save it**, said a friend to me some 5 years ago.

The intellectuals debate, the capitalists exploit and the masses are so busy living and unwinding, it's a wonder there are still those that DARE WIN THE DAY!

* Draw parallels to your own life and realize that often, people we know embody heroism and that we do not recognize them enough

# Session 1: Mythology and Fiction

Characters:

* Roark = Architect of Human Destiny
* Slartibartfast = Architect of Paradise

## [Howard Roark](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/letters-and-speeches/roarks-speech/) - Protagonist of Any Rand's The Fountainhead

<p class="speakable">Howard Roark's Courtroom Speech about the hero / creator</p>
1. Thousands of years ago, the first man discovered how to make fire. He was probably burned at the stake he had taught his brothers to light. He was considered an evildoer who had dealt with a demon mankind dreaded. But thereafter men had fire to keep them warm, to cook their food, to light their caves. He had left them a gift they had not conceived and he had lifted darkness off the earth. Centuries later, the first man invented the wheel. He was probably torn on the rack he had taught his brothers to build. He was considered a transgressor who ventured into forbidden territory. But thereafter, men could travel past any horizon. He had left them a gift they had not conceived and he had opened the roads of the world.
2. That man, the unsubmissive and first, stands in the opening chapter of every legend mankind has recorded about its beginning. Prometheus was chained to a rock and torn by vultures-because he had stolen the fire of the gods. Adam was condemned to suffer-because he had eaten the fruit of the tree of knowledge. Whatever the legend, somewhere in the shadows of its memory mankind knew that its glory began with one and that that one paid for his courage.
3. Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision. Their goals differed, but they all had this in common: that the step was first, the road new, the vision unborrowed, and the response they received-hatred.

## [Prometheus](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/works/prometheus-unbound/), the God that dared bring fire to mankind.

<p class="speakable">Intro to Prometheus Unbound, the Shelley Epic</p>
1. Prometheus is a Titan, who in Greek mythology is credited with the creation of man from clay and the theft of fire for human use, an act that enabled progress and civilization. He is known for his intelligence, and as a champion of mankind.
2. Prometheus was punished for this theft by Zeus, king of the Olympian gods, who sentenced the Titan to eternal torment for his transgression.
3. Prometheus Unbound best combines the various elements of Shelley's genius in their most complete expression, and unites harmoniously his lyrically creative power of imagination and his 'passion for reforming the world.' It is the fruit of an outburst of poetic energy under the double stimulus of his enthusiastic Greek studies, begun under Peacock's influence, and of his delight in the beauty of Italy, whither he had removed for health and rest. It marks his full mastery of his powers.

## Prelude

### Shasa gives background

Simon said "I want to live in a good country", and I'm sure of the 2000 people he gathered to seed it's virtual existence with UN ratification on the horizon, there were enough utopians who would think of problems like "not enough bicycle paths" (George Carlin) and gross complainers - each jousting in the competition to emerge as lone, scintillating saviour of the world.

There was a young fool who saw the need for a "chain reaction" and who still dreams of [catalysis and critical mass](http://imran.yieldmore.org/catalyst/), but his own fellow "countryman" and team leader couldn't listen to his thoughts of magnifying the works of the existing heroes. And now, "Marvellous Heroes United" doesnt even exist in the verbiage of the [Secret Universal Mind](http://imran.yieldmore.org/charter/), but it waits for another shot of the [Infinite Perspective Vortex](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Perspective_Vortex).

Foolish young kid who believes in the power of collective action and coalition (Every Man a Tiger, Chuck Horner) - not of armchair warriors who often fail (End of Innocence, Don Henley) and still Imagines (John Lennon) [Adventure and Romance on the High Plains](http://imran.yieldmore.org/curious-lives/) (Monty, Curious Lives) as dreamed of by the [Lone Bird that returned from heaven](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/works/jonathan-livingston-seagull/) to tell of [adventure fables from an enchanting world](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15073099W/Curious_lives?edition=ia%3Acuriouslivesadve0000bach).

### Dharti sanctions enlightentment

[her hopes as voice of mother nature to uplift the masses, dismantle the guerrila war machinery and remove the oligarchs]


### Shasa speaks of DNA and Alliances

Let's not storm the Bastille, rather just free people in it - both the opressors and the oppressed - and ignoring it altogether, beginning the [last renaisance](http://imran.yieldmore.org/the-neverending-story/) that makes our's a civilization [par excellence](http://imran.yieldmore.org/join-us/).

An idea is a greater monument than a cathedral (Spencer Tracy) and our architects have given us ideas of COMPELLING LOVE!

### Naradha speaks of collective action and sustainability
