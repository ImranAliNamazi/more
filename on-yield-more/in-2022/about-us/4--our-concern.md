## Concern

* YieldMore.org, conceived in late 2013 was designed to bring caring and passionate people together to delight in and colour each other's lives.
* It is only by knowing pain first hand that we can relate to those of a loved one and then decide to go all out for them. I love you, Earth and want to help you heal. As Billy would say&hellip; it's all about soul!
* As our lives have been shaped by loved ones both here and gone, so too we have the power to love more and shape other's lives.
* As the healing goes side by side, so too, let the daring and the courage to face life and live it on our own terms.
* A few times have I been witness to the power of words - Feanor, Goldberg, Chiang and wish to speak now of the poetry that is the tapestry we weave around ourselves.
* No outburst of mine would be complete without giving due credit to Master Niggle whose art shone across and lit the fabric of creation! Like Slartibartfast, the very designer of Heaven (Ea or Earth) with its immense beauty.
* So, let us show concern and care in all that we do, with the hopes that when we meet our heavenly father, we can throw our good deeds into the reckoning.
