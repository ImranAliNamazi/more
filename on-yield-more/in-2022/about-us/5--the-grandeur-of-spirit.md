* Someone I knew wrote a book called the Grandeur of Spirit and it's only as I write this that I realize that that spontaneous expression of His Play (or Lila) is the highest humanity can reach.
* We are indeed heading back to our illimitable origins, for it's time our Mother wakes us from our stupor and guides us from our adolescent folly back into the Light.
* Why do we not choose our highest right instead of our darkest wrong? This illuminating choice presents itself to us a million times each day and if you keep feeling ONE with the universe, you will feel tranquility and guided by loving hands.
* [Yes, Father, we too choose LOVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXConbU3MdQ).
* In this spirit of things, I have chosen to be a catalyst, with the hope that one day the drops will all add up and we will together know the meaning of being an AWE inspired witness of creation / evolution unfolding.
* Lets espouse our causes more dearly, being ever mindful of the company we keep, and let our children keep.
* I stand for peace - so much more pregnant than just the absence of malice and discord.
