## Ideas

* YieldMore.org is a platform for sharing ideas that this Earth desperately needs. Ideas for a complete overhaul of the system as we refuse to circle the drain anymore.
* Ideas that MAY take hold on forward thinking minds.
* It still refuses to be yet another organisation or company, but rather wishes to aid in the creation of empowered individuals, conscious businesses and truly munificent charities.
* My goal is to build and accelerate 20 such umbrellas or pockets of hope by 2025.
* I wish to remain acknowledged for the ideas I've had and [remunerated for them](../model/) and for the time I lend to YOUR ideas, initiatives and aspirations. We may call this fair trade and I hope that they will each start a CASCADE of ripples or a symphony of harmony.
* Finally feeling brave, I wish now, to come into my own as a creator of content and collaborator on issues of international concern.
* I choose to begin with [Education](../children/), [Healing](../words/) and the creation of [Spaces](../spaces/) where we can accelerate these and I would like dearly to know more about where this baby can go.
