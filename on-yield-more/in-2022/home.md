## Greetings with PEACE and LOVE!

* We could decide to walk the [path of evolution](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/IMzgNkgJYhc), being [Composers and Orchestrators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXwts6qzXlk#character=GlenHolland) and [sing a new anthem of humanity](https://imran.yieldmore.org/charter/).
* The words from 2017 that "[YieldMore is a link between people, organizations and movements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTIqjpkF5Ss)" has come back to haunt me! Specifically = it ISN'T - IT WANTS TO BE...
* Now there are a dozen ideas on [the current website](./sitemap/) with the [archives](https://archives.yieldmore.org/) and [legacy](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/) with a lot of curation. [My writing](https://imran.yieldmore.org/tags/poems/) deals with quite a few topics and themes.
* Here you will find my [ideas and notes for children](./children/) (where I am most passionate, though my only qualification is in still being child-like), [thoughts on the workplace](./sunlight/), wants for [new age healing](./serenity/).
* Also [desires for groups](./groups/) with its [Imaginative Communities](./groups/imaginative-communities/) and [Intimate Healing](./groups/intimate-gatherings/) workshops on the anvil, I hope you recognize the delightful child in me, reaching out to the child in you that we may delight in each other's lives and [make music together](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/books/the-silmarillion/ainulindale/).
* Ever evolving is the [DNA or Growing Together MODEL](./symphony/growing-together/) along with other pages [we tag symphony](./symphony/).
* Recently, a friend rekindled my interest in TECH as a valuable skill to be taught to youngsters so I immediately created [Labours of Love](https://love.yieldmore.org/) where [I hope to relearn](https://love.yieldmore.org/teachers/imran/) simple [game development](https://github.com/yieldmore/games) and [electronics](https://2005.cselian.com/electronics/) and have a bunch of teachers and children showcase their work.
* I choose to intersperse my classes with thoughts of [the big picture](https://imran.yieldmore.org/all/for/msa/), [ARYA](./children/arya/) (Awareness Resulting in Your Action) and [Life's Missions](http://amadeusweb.com/).
* All are welcome to join me to expand any of these fledgeling ideas, and once we hit the right vibe, I hope you find me affable and able to deliver ideas successfully.
* One thing to note, ideas come with certain stipulations from the DNA Model and we are still on the threshold of the world.
