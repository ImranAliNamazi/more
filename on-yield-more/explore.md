YieldMore.org is a platform for establishing ideas. We need the right ideas to help usher in a new age where people are becoming more accomodating and caring for one another.

* Mindfulness is the new watch word and we need to know of people and organizations that can help us introspect and dig up all the right values, convictions and goals.
* Experts need to be promoted somewhere special where importance is given to their values and respect towards fellow beings and the environment.
* They need to be capable of producing the highest quality work / consulting and be open to sharing their knowledge with customers and juniors alike.
* We need a stellar portal for professionals, healers, educators and social workers (charities) from all walks of life that is searchable and showcases their work, their thoughts, their insights and the various dimensions of their being. We need a Conscious Marketplace!
* Sign up to promote yourself on our platform and to author articles and videos establishing your credentials. If we do not find you enough work / an audience within a year's time, we will return your subscription fee.
* What sets us apart is that your profile is made available offline as well and promoted by team members and peers, at our events, in meetings with posssible clients and at community centers where we operate. We also help you with media and promotion services.
