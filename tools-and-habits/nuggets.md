<h2>YM Nuggets Home - <em>"Propel your goals"</em></h2>
by organizing ideas, information, and tasks.

<ol>
	<li><b>Nuggets</b> are small pieces of <u>digested</u> information with links to articles online.</li>
	<li><b>A whole library</b> of them can be built by you in your chosen area of expertise, using <a href="../apps/downloads/todolist_exe.zip" target="_blank">abstractspoon's todolist</a> or <a href="https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/" target="_blank">CherryTree</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Nugget Banks</b> (personal files) - <a href="https://bitbucket.org/yieldmore/nuggets/" target="_blank">an app we are building</a> will let you organize libraries and banks in a single workspace.</li>
	<li><b>Personal tasks and activities</b> (referring to libraries) can be organized into tabs and windows in your banks as your own personal knowledge management tool.</a>.
</ol>

<u>For Example:</u>

 - A UN affiliated Charity Could create course material on the SDGs for Children and this becomes a library
 - You create another library with exercises and class notes and publish it to your students
 - The students use our app to create workspaces including both libraries and flood it with their tasks / notes.

<u>Advantages</u>

 - Orgs and Teams have a way of knowledge management / intangibles as trackable tasks.
 - Your personal ambitions can be furthered by subscribing to the libraries of your favourite gurus / teachers
 - More organizations like yieldmore come forward to create courses / libraries

Since the foundation is a little text / html around a link online (a digest), the libraries themselves are only LINKS to RESOURCES ONLINE, but around a topic.

We will also build a feature to navigate TDL/CT files (nugget banks / libraries) into <a href="https://amadeus.yieldmore.org/" target="_blank">Amadeus</a> (which powers our website). This would likely be a drive feature.

You can already begin making your library by checking out [TDL](https://www.abstractspoon.com/) / [CherryTree]
