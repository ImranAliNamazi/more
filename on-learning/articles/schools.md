Respected Teacher / Parent,

We would like you to join our **education forum** to discuss our **Various Class Ideas** and other programs that we promote as well as spread word about formulae that have worked for you and courses / programs that you find useful.

The Wish Class aims to engage the children in self-chosen co and extra curricular activities in the school, both during and after school hours, in a non disruptive manner and is currently being piloted by [Imran](%nodeUrl%people/imran/).

We request you to get your parents and teachers to interact more frequently and network with other PTA groups from other schools on our forum.

Ask for a sample wish class which can be arranged online.

Ask us to organize online workshops.

Form a Core Group of teachers and parents to find more #JoyfulLearningActivities for the students.

Try and make the children truly enthusiastic about what they are learning and guide their all round emotional, spiritual and social development.

Regards,
Imran, 8 April 2020 & 28 Feb 2021
