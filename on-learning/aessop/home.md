# Implementation Possibilities

1. Take sessions first for a subset of a class for those interested.
2. Invite parents to an open discussion before / during to explore ways in which the class format and topic could benefit the children and how similar curated exposure and discussion at home could strengthen the manifestation of the shared goals. To eventually invite them to the classroom and to [Collective Parenting](../collective-parenting/) sessions.
3. Find a co-facilitator from school staff / parents and revisit the lesson plan progression with them.
4. Run the program outside a school or online, helping would be facilitators move into that role.
5. Setup teams of teachers working together using our growth model.
