## 1 Music Led Classroom Discussion (11+)

1. The teacher or facilitator chooses music that speaks of different themes which they would like to introduce the class to. This may include inspiration, philosophic, tales of war and peace, themes of everyday living, global awareness, cultures from other places, exemplary art and musical talent, popular culture etc.
2. The children are asked to close their eyes and let the music and words tickle their imagination. The song may be played a second time.
3. A few minutes is given to absorb the experience and reflect on the feelings. The children are asked to write a few lines that may come to mind spontaneously.
4. The Teacher then asks for feelings had and parts of the song which the children could relate to.
5. A discussion evolves then the children are asked to make (as lengthy as possible) essays out of it.
6. Once this is done, the teacher leads the discussion into the topics they may have had in mind when selecting the song.
7. The teacher records the notes from the class against the original lesson plan and submits it to the YieldMore Repository as feedback / inputs for further developments.

## Notes on Music Led Classroom Discussion

1. Conceived in 2019 and [initiated in 2021](https://archives.yieldmore.org/curation-based-education/) and piloted successfully in a school with 8 adolescents, this is now being tried in contexts where the songs are also being used to increase language fluency.
2. Imran and the teachers he had the good fortune to work with still remember the effect "It's All Right Here" and "Coming Back to Life" had on the students.
3. As of Dec 2022, Imran can also say that it was introduced with printouts to a group of 6 children who really liked the music and each child found something interesting in the choice of lyrics.
