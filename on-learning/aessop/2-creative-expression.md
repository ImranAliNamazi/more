## 2 Creative Expression (11+)

1. First outlined in 2020, CX believes in the triad - Classroom Comfort and Encouragement | Exploring Viewpoints and Discussion | Higher Order Thinking.
2. To facilitate this, we use Stimulating Music and Audio Programs | Child planned activities, and encourage additions to their Routine and Journaling.
3. Children are exposed to various forms of music, writing and art, from the world, our network, the teacher's selection and even from the teacher's own writing. The last 2 make it a lot more relatable with the students.
4. Children are requested to write on their own, feeling inspired by all that the teacher has presented in that class. Teachers give feedback as they finish their writing and help make their thoughts flow when they get stuck.
5. Additionally a "topic for writing" may have been chosen beforehand - this may vary from class to class.
6. In the spirit of ENTHEOS, devotional prayers may feature in these classes, especially that it gives students an opportunity to articulate and discuss their various faiths.
7. To form healthy [worldviews](https://noetic.org/experience/worldview-explorations/).
