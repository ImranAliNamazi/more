PACT, the education forum of YieldMore.org is networking PTAs, Educational Institutions and thought leaders (senior educators) and encouraging them to cross pollinate ideas.

We hope to bring you articles and viewpoints and put you in direct touch with people from diverse professions, who are involved in the holistic development of your children.

In time we will manage / suggest a host of activities and programs for you and your children, and conduct online meetings to help remove misconceptions and empower you to shape their futures in a powerful manner.

For now, if you could <a href="javascript:void();" class="toggle-engage engage-pact">join the dialogue</a> with your perspectives and queries, that would be splendid.

## Strategy - Notes

* Money from school first then parents for engaging especially boarders.
* It would be from parents for the program, esp who comes to us 1-1 or in interested groups.
* A heat map of which teachers are aligned to us in which school and make them weekend part timers or get buy-in from schools to let them conduct classes and we do training, monitoring and assessing.
* Professionals. Only when required. More emphasis on environment of the class and the healing through joyful and meaningful activity

## Marketing Technique

Digital Assets / Social Media to create content and prep the market and find out who is interested.

This series of events that we call the "P. A. C. T.  OPEN  MIC" is a simple format and is best described as

* OPEN MIC is a current trend among youth to have a break and have some fun time with a group. 
* OPEN MIC helps them connect with others in a non imposing way, yet bringing a lot of cheer among the participants. 
* An idea arose, why not allow all stakeholders around the institution - Parent, Administrato, Children and the Teachers to have a regular system of fun and frolic and develop new bonding and fellowship among them?
* This would be a combined playful gathering of young and old in an open hearted environment.
