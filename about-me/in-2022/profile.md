Still a [decent programmer](../resume/) I have evolved the various ideas and programs of [YieldMore.org](../../sitemap/) - built over 9 years and 5+ iterations and nearly  a 1000 pages if you include [my writing](https://imran.yieldmore.org/about-imran/).

I also evolved the tech for these and many more websites using [Amadeus Web](https://amadeusweb.com/) which is a baseline for my web blogging and tech learning courses. No, I do not use wordpress anymore.

Today I am interested in

* Encouraging youngsters to [express](https://imran.yieldmore.org/poems/category/children/) themselves and find their [unique swing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=git61nISYK8).
* Watch as they [keep smiling](https://imran.yieldmore.org/keep-smiling/) and [face the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URwXr144hlI).
* Explore abilities in [electronics and programming](https://love.yieldmore.org/teachers/imran/) as a means of [achieving something](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/books/beyond-man/25-auroville/) with the acquired skill.
* Help the devising of [spaces](../../healing/spaces/) and the trying of multiple modalities of [healing](../../healing/).
* Propping upto 20 odd teams with a model of [Growing Together](../../how/).

From my experiences as a writer, I feel inspired to run my own workshops but need some support from a few co-facilitators and encouragement from the first batches of attendees.

Also, to expand the content laid out in the programs and courses menu, now the mainstay of YM with [Intimate Gatherings](../groups/intimate-gatherings/) and  [Imaginative Communities](../groups/imaginative-communities/)

# As a healer and a novice creator of affirmations 

My journey began at age 13 when I gave a 1 hour massage to my friend and mentor. 2 years later I learnt Reiki but did not practice it till nearly 2017. I'm now trying to give body massages and show family members how they can do this for each other. Head, Scalp, Face, Neck, Shoulders, Back, Arms, Hands, Legs, Feet, Spine etc are places where I apply different kinds of massaging techniques. All this is very intuitive and self taught. Sometimes I include an affirmation and a guided meditation, inspired by the likes of [Kelly Howell](https://brainsync.com/).

I have been know to [write affirmations](https://imran.yieldmore.org/for-a-mother/) and look forward to making more tailored ones for the friends I make.

# As a creator of programs for Children

[2 Childrens Programs](../children/) were already piloted at CASCADEFLS.org viz. Music Led Discussion and Creative Expression (Mostly Writing). I am looking for mature parents who would want to expose their wards to the maladies of society and help them find causes they care about and can contribute to. This is called [Project ARYA](../symphony/arya/) (Awareness Resulting in YOUR Action) and am yet to find a batch of students for this. a Fourth program deals more with [interfaith understanding and dialogue](../symphony/spirit/) and is called ENTHEOS.
