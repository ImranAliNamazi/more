<p class="speakable">Evolving Sunlight and its relevance in the workplace</p>

1. Evolving Sunlight is a series of programs, workshops and activities that help companies improve their technical skills and motivational levels, processes and team dynamics. 
2. We will one day be a group of trainers and facilitators who want to make companies independent of us as early as possible. Our approach is to get middle level and junior employees to take ownership of and drive the sharing of subjects or topics and make them present it with guidance from their seniors. 
3. Programs we institute should be self-propelled by the 3rd or 6th month. 
4. We ask that companies divide into 4 groups, coordinated by the HR Team as: 1) Management, 2) Leads and VPs, 3) Seniors, 4) Rest of Employees
5. The HR Team builds a 3 month plan along with their Leads which gets approved by management before its initiated.
6. A repository of **Presentations** and **Technical Exercises** is made available to everyone. Seniors and Employees are asked to "flesh out" the topics proposed into presentations. 
7. Each Technology Team is asked to write a Guidelines or Coding Guidelines document which can be fine tuned per project or team. 
8. A Review, **Code Review** and **Retrospective** process is initiated.
9. Forums for Technical, **Work Environment** and General are created, policies are made available. 
10. An induction / orientation document is made along with an Organization Chart. Code from each employee is put in a common repository (exercises) 
11. We cover Professional Development and also Technical and Personal as well.

# How to Use Skills and Intuition

There was once an impulsive decision to assume command and improvise on the spot. Knowing full well [Pirsig's Metaphysics of Quality](../spirit/) and still revering the STATIC MUD ENCRUSTED System that robs us of initiative, I chose STILL TO FLOUT EVERY RULE.
