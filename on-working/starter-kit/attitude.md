This document is as I wrote it for a former client. It's a beginning point for a series  of discussions with potential team members to join and adopt [YM's Growing Together Model](../growing-together/). 

# Attitude Discussion

Welcome Candidate / Team Member,

In this round, you are asked to write us a brief intro about yourself based on these expectations and summarize which 5 points define you best / you can relate to. Be direct and honest and tell yourself you will improve in other areas where there is scope.

---

## Attitude - General
- **Due Diligence and Discipline**<br />
	Teammates are hands-on and use their talents to the utmost. Will never be idle because of commitment to team contribution and self growth.
- **Deep Dive & Ownership**<br />
	Own the task / ask completely and dont be afraid to learn new technologies / habits or processes. Think ahead and make sure you mitigate the risks that may impact the outcome. Communicate regularly with your team and make sure there are no blockers. Ownership also includes setting the expectation correctly / doing a course correct as necessary.
- **Good Communication, strong team commitment and interpersonal skills**<br />
	There is always ample room for growth here at all levels. Think of yourself as a work in progress and think that your teammates / leads as supportive in this joint journey. When we fail, we fail as a team. When you trust in the process, then every event / decision is an opportunity for growth.
- **Emotional Intelligence - ability to self-evaluate and get along with teammates both professionally and personally.**<br />
	Commitment to growth in this area will take you far, for as they say, if you want to go the distance, work together. EI includes the ability to help one another for the common good of the team and company.
- **Commitment to self improvement and presentation**<br />
	Once again this is a continuous process where, as they say, sometimes failure is a stepping stone to success. It is also said that your attitude determines your altitude. All of us can improve our quality of thoughts, learn to work smarter and increase throughput by finding more creative ways to work with each other. Presentation forms a large part of this.
- **Healthy desire for more leadership roles**<br />
	As you grow, the team and the organization grows, but remember that good leaders help juniors grow into the roles they have filled in the past.
- **Awareness of roles played and seeing things from the other's perspective**<br />
	The team spirit will be enhanced more and more when we understand each other, not just as people, but by the many roles we play in this organization. A deep concern for the other's wellbeing will take us a long way to growing as individuals.
- **Knowing when to focus, when to take help and ask for inputs**<br />
	Sometimes we are full of ideas, sometimes there are conflicting thoughts or demoralizing situations (both from life / the workplace) - learning to prioritize, focus, finish and take baby steps when required is important.
- **How do you align yourself with the company's values and your own moral compass**<br />
	Each company has a signature, characteristic work ethic and serves certain communities / segments of the public. The more you understand the people and leaders around you, you will automatically attune yourself to their positive traits and in this way have a mutually beneficial relationship.
- **Thoughts about the work-ecosystem, society and beyond**<br />
	We encourage and value inputs from those who want to be conscientious and contributing members to society apart from the profession. For those applying who've had varied experience, this is a natural topic for conversation.
