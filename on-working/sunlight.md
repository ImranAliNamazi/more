## Evolving Sunlight

An OEx Team is the core team of a company that drives its Quality or Continuous Improvement Process. Like any team, it needs goals, iterations, leads, stakeholders, process and a prioritization system. So we suggest creating an "Operational Excellence" project in your favourite Project Management Tool and rolling up your sleeves!

Quality not seen in the narrow way of testing each task, but as in the vision of Total Quality Management (Bill Creech).

We suggest you first list the factors that affect the outcome, such as

* Process
* Training
* Enthusiasm
* Personal Discipline (Due Diligence)
* Talent
* Documentation
* Task Management and Specifications Detailing

These become the categories / tags. Now the GOALS of the Management for each Team become the features that need to be achieved. What follows is a group (OrgEx team) exercise in task breakdown, estimation, prioritization and making a workable scope in each.

Once a few milestones worth of goals and tasks are fed into the system, the key players from management are presented and a backlog grooming session is done. Launch the project and give the whole company / its team leaders tasks on a daily basis. It's now time to roll up your sleeves and get everyone working in unison.

All the very best. Tell me when the baby is born and management is happy with the outcome!
