Welcome to YieldMore.org, I'm Imran it's founder who has worked as a programmer for over 20 years.

While I was a student, I read Tom Clancy's Every Man a Tiger which blew my mind. Could maintenance downtimes in the air force really be brought down from 20 days to 4 hours simply by giving ownership and pride down the line to every last colleague and team member?

I kept going back to this book which spoke of managers more as cheerleaders which today I correlate with the "[inverting of the management pyramid](https://hbr.org/2008/10/its-time-to-invert-the-managem)" and what we learnt back in college about treating "internal customers" (employees) well.

A while before, Richard Back had spoken of peak perfection, something I still chase with my own very aesthetic website programing platform amadeusweb.com.

In 2013, these fructified as [tigers](./tigers/) and in 2019 as [OrgEx](./organizational-excellence/).

I've always coded well, striving for the "art of programming" and have led teams and mentored juniors over the years.

Today, in 2023, with the work series at YieldMore.org, I am offering my rich experience and passion for work to tech and non tech teams and companies as well.

I believe in a future where we have Conscious Businesses holding their own with forward thinking companies world over.
