When George Carlin said "we have the conceit to think we can save the planet," he was actually using an advanced form of reverse psychology to dare us to do it in record time, because my dear friends, the tragedy is, "the earth is dying!". And we've many of us become mindless automatons and passive bystanders.

Mankind with its industrial revolution and tree burning furnaces has her in a stranglehold. Which is why I laud Carlin's [Natural Disasters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRAJYVRSuMg) and [this other piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9Cs6KPTus) so much. More reverse psychology going on.

It's only our love for each other and ALL of this [pale blue dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWPFmdAWRZ0), and the taking away of control from those who would bludgeon her to death that can [win the day](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/talks/who-speaks-for-earth-carl-sagan/).

So find your [friendly neighbourhood eco warrior](https://captainplanetfoundation.org/about/our-story/captain-planet-the-planeteers-legacy/) and let the countermeasures begin. We ARE running out of time.

It's not just the environment of nature that needs saving, but the political ones, the home ones, and most importantly the seeds of lies and distrust we sow in our own hearts, minds, and families.

So think greatly of the company you keep, find it in your heart to heal and strengthen yourself and JOIN THE FRAY.

As [Philip Wollen says, MEAT is the new asbestos](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/movements/loving-nature/philip-wollen/), and whereas for some time, [I championed vegetarianism](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/topics/vegetarianism/), the [double standard here](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/movements/loving-nature/vegan-activist/) is, I'm now a [part time non vegetarian](https://www.meat.org/).

Don't let the contradictions sway you, [find your cause](https://imran.yieldmore.org/catalyst/) and rally forth to establish your truth, one of [Ahimsa or non violence](https://www.mkgandhi.org/articles/ahimsa-Its-theory-and-practice-in-Gandhism.html) as I believe it must turn out to be.
